Answers: A: MOND is a theory that reduces the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by postulating the existence of a new form of matter called \"fuzzy dark matter.\" B: MOND is a theory that increases the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 20. C: MOND is a theory that explains the missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters that was previously considered dark matter by demonstrating that the mass is in the form of neutrinos and axions. D: MOND is a theory that reduces the discrepancy between the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters and the measured velocity dispersions from a factor of around 10 to a factor of about 2. E: MOND is a theory that eliminates the observed missing baryonic mass in galaxy clusters by imposing a new mathematical formulation of gravity that does not require the existence of dark matter.'"
